# mochify

A library for creating Mochi cards to learn languages like Swedish using spaced repetition.

## What is Mochi?

[Mochi](https://mochi.cards) is a modern spaced repetition app for studying and memorization. It allows you to create digital flashcards and review them at optimal intervals to maximize retention.

## What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time. Instead of cramming, you review cards just before you're likely to forget them. This method has been scientifically proven to improve long-term retention and is particularly effective for language learning, vocabulary acquisition, and memorizing facts.

The algorithm schedules reviews based on your performance:
- Cards you know well are shown less frequently
- Cards you struggle with are shown more often
- Review intervals gradually increase as you demonstrate mastery
